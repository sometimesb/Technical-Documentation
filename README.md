# 🌐 Technical Documentation Page
A project for freeCodeCamp to illustrate using HTML and CSS to create a technical documentation page.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
Super simple project. I just used the following:
* HTML
* CSS 

## General Process:
1. Reset the box sizing to border box
2. I enforced an outline to *everything* using the global selector -> makes it easier to visualize my boxes!
3. Built the basic HTML structure in accordance to FCC tests without id's/classes and added when appropriate.
4. Built navbar container.
5. Built list within the navbar, I only had to do this once for one item and I reused the same CSS selectors to not have to duplicate code.
6. Moved to each 'section' of the table of contents, ie 'introduction', and reused the same classes again to not redo the same code.
7. Media queries for smaller screens.
